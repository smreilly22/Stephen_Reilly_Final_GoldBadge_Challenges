# Stephen Reilly's Final Challenges for the Gold Badge 

## ABOUT 
The projects in this solution are the challenges I did for the final at Eleven Fifty.

## Getting Started
Click on the Final_Challenges.sln of the folder to use the project.
For the ones that I offered for normal grading start with the number followed the Challenge name, like 02_Claims
If I did extra challenges, they will start with Extra_Challenge.
If I did a challenge that I couldn't figure out and not want to be graded, but wanted to save for later, it will start with Z_DontGrade.

## Process 
How you should read each one, to check my work, there are two projets for each challenge: one for repository, other for console.
1. Start with the repository project of the challenge to see the start of my process. It has 3 files: My Object Class file, Repository file, and Testing file.
2. Started with making The Object Class with properties.
3. Next will be the the repo. Those have my CRUD methods in there to Add, Read, Update, or Delete things later on.
this will have Repo at the end of the file name.
4. Then it will be my RepoTest, where I tested out my CRUD methods to make sure they are good to go.
5. After all that, go to the Console project for the challenge, which consists of my ProgramUi file and Program file
6. The ProgramUI for each challenge has what the program will be running. It connects with the repository for the particular challenge
7. The Program file itself is the last part and it actually runs the Console. 

## Experience 
Not going lie, this was challenging, but I learned a lot doing these challenges. 
I'm still relatively new to all this, but I feel rewarded and gained a lot knowledge out of doing this.
Still can be a headache though.

## Roadmap
So I want to continue completing challenges in the near future. Even if completed, I want to do them right. So if I think I can do it better in the future, I will come back and improve the project.
